# VPS Services — Architecture

## Overview

Self-hosted Supabase stack on a VPS, managed via a single `docker-compose.yml` with Docker profiles. Databases (Postgres, Redis) are accessible only via SSH tunnel. Supabase Studio and API are publicly accessible via Caddy at `https://supabase.nyhasinavalona.com`.

## Services

### Core (always running)

| Service | Image | Port | Access |
|---------|-------|------|--------|
| Postgres | `supabase/postgres:15.8.1.060` | `127.0.0.1:5432` | SSH tunnel only |
| Redis | `redis:7-alpine` | `127.0.0.1:6379` | SSH tunnel only |

### Supabase stack (`--profile supabase`)

| Service | Image | Port | Access |
|---------|-------|------|--------|
| Kong (API gateway) | `kong:2.8.1` | `127.0.0.1:8000` | Via Caddy |
| Studio (dashboard) | `supabase/studio:20241202-71911c6` | `127.0.0.1:3000` | Via Caddy |
| Auth (GoTrue) | `supabase/gotrue:v2.158.1` | internal | — |
| REST (PostgREST) | `postgrest/postgrest:v12.2.0` | internal | — |
| Realtime | `supabase/realtime:v2.34.47` | internal | — |
| Storage | `supabase/storage-api:v1.11.13` | internal | — |
| Meta (pg-meta) | `supabase/postgres-meta:v0.84.2` | internal | — |

All services share a single Docker bridge network (`vps-net`).

## Key design decisions

**Shared Postgres** — Supabase services and your own apps connect to the same Postgres instance. Supabase uses its own schemas (`auth`, `storage`, `_realtime`, `graphql_public`); your apps use `public`.

**Shared Redis** — Supabase Realtime uses Redis for pub/sub. The same Redis instance is exposed for your other apps via SSH tunnel.

**DB-less Kong** — Kong runs in declarative mode (`KONG_DATABASE=off`), reading all routes and ACL rules from `volumes/kong/kong.yml` at startup. No Kong database needed.

**`wal_level=logical`** — Postgres is started with logical replication enabled so Supabase Realtime can stream row-level changes via the replication protocol.

**Caddy on host (not in Docker)** — Caddy is installed directly on the VPS. Since Docker ports are bound to `127.0.0.1` on the host, Caddy can reach them without any Docker network bridging or port re-binding.

## Volumes

| Volume | Used by | Contents |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `postgres-data` | Postgres | Database files |
| `redis-data` | Redis | AOF persistence |
| `storage-data` | Storage | Uploaded files |
